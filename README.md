IMDB-Scraper
===========

IMDB provides various [alternative interfaces](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces) for their database.

One of them is the plain text version( [fu-berlin.de Mirror](ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/), [funet.fi Mirror](ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/ftp.imdb.com/pub/) and [sunet.se Mirror](ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/tv+movies/imdb/))

This script is designed to scrape though the actors.list and actresses.list files and get the actor name and each actor's film name.

Depends on Mark Pilgrim's roman.py included for convenience.
